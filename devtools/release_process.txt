Python IPK
==========

If a new one of these is released (not often), then build and push to the OPKG
repository before doing the other steps. See the roborio-packages repo for
details on those steps.

WPILib/HAL pip packages
=======================

To build/upload these to pypi, run the following::

    ./upload_pypi.sh

Build a release package
=======================

To build a complete robotpy package, make sure you've done the following:

* Tagged the release in git, and pushed the tag to github
* You've uploaded the pip packages to pypi (see above)

Finally, run this script to build a zipfile, which will end up in
the dist directory at the root of the repository.

    ./build_installer.sh

After the release package has been uploaded to github with release notes,
send an email to the mailing list!
