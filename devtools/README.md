This directory contains tools that are useful for RobotPy developers. Most
users will not need to use these tools (though, build_and_deploy.sh could
be useful for users who find bugs).

If you are on Windows, you can run these scripts if you have MSYS installed,
and execute the scripts from the MSYS bash shell.
